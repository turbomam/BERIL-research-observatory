# Bakta Reannotation of Pangenome Cluster Representatives

## Status

**Complete.** All 4 tables ingested into `kbase_ke_pangenome` on 2026-03-12.

### What was done

1. Annotated all **132,538,155** protein cluster representatives (from 27,690 species) using `bakta_proteins` v1.12.0 on NERSC Perlmutter
2. Extracted per-chunk tables (176 chunks) and combined into 4 final TSVs
3. Uploaded TSVs to MinIO user staging area
4. Ingested into Delta Lake via `data_lakehouse_ingest` on JupyterHub

## Bakta vs EggNOG Comparison

Comparison script: `scripts/compare_bakta_eggnog.py` (Spark-optimized, all joins stay in Spark).

### Per-field coverage (132.5M clusters)

| Annotation | Bakta | % | EggNOG | % | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gene name | 29.0M | 21.9% | 93.4M | 70.4% | EggNOG |
| Product/Description | 94.4M | 71.2% | 93.4M | 70.4% | Bakta |
| EC number | 19.0M | 14.4% | 25.9M | 19.6% | EggNOG |
| COG (informative) | 10.8M | 8.2% | 67.6M | 51.0% | EggNOG |
| KEGG KO | 22.9M | 17.3% | 51.0M | 38.5% | EggNOG |
| GO terms | 19.9M | 15.0% | 9.8M | 7.4% | Bakta |
| UniRef50 | 105.0M | 79.2% | — | — | Bakta |
| Pfam | 10.2M | 7.7% | 83.7M | 63.1% | EggNOG |

### Why bakta's COG/KEGG/Pfam coverage is lower

This is **by design, not a bug** — confirmed by bakta's developer (Oliver Schwengers) across multiple GitHub issues (#350, #385, #391, #393). The coverage gap reflects a precision/recall tradeoff:

| Factor | Impact | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Orthology transfer vs. sequence matching | Major | eggNOG maps proteins to orthologous groups (OGs) and transfers ALL OG annotations ("guilt by association"). Bakta matches to a specific UniRef90 representative and only transfers what's pre-computed for that entry. Higher recall vs. higher specificity. |
| Sparse PSC pre-computed annotations | Major | Bakta's PSC database only has COG/KEGG/EC for a fraction of UniRef90 entries (~14% have COG, ~19% have KEGG in our 10k pilot). The PSC DB is optimized for product descriptions and gene names, not functional categories. |
| COG 2024 mapping limitations | Moderate | COG 2024 no longer provides representative sequences, forcing an indirect WP accession→IPS→PSC mapping that loses many connections (issue #393). |
| Pfam skipped for non-hypotheticals | Major | Bakta runs HMMER only on proteins that remain "hypothetical" after PSC matching (~7.7%). The 92% that got a PSC product description never get Pfam searched. |
| DIAMOND fast vs. HMM sensitivity | Minor | Bakta's PSC uses DIAMOND fast mode, less sensitive than eggNOG's HMM-based ortholog assignment. |

The bakta developer planned to re-annotate PSC representatives using eggNOG to boost COG/KEGG coverage (issue #325). This may have partially happened in DB v6.0, but our results suggest limited impact.

**Bottom line**: `bakta_proteins` runs the full protein annotation pipeline and is the correct tool. The two tools are complementary by design — bakta prioritizes specificity, eggNOG prioritizes sensitivity.

### Combined coverage (union of both tools)

| Annotation | EggNOG alone | Bakta alone | Union | Gain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KEGG | 38.5% | 17.3% | **41.4%** | +2.9pp |
| EC | 19.6% | 14.4% | **22.8%** | +3.2pp |
| GO | 7.4% | 15.0% | **18.2%** | +10.8pp |
| Any function | 70.4% | 71.2% | **77.3%** | +6.1pp |

### Rescue analysis

- **39.2M clusters** have NO eggNOG annotation at all (29.4%)
  - Of these, bakta provides a product description for 11.2M (28.6%)
  - Bakta provides a UniRef50 link for 17.7M (45.1%)
- **7.5M clusters** have eggNOG but no description
  - Bakta rescues 5.3M of these (70.4%) with a functional annotation

### UniRef50 bridge to UniProt

Bakta provides UniRef50 IDs for 79.2% of clusters (105M). These can bridge to external databases via `kbase_uniprot.uniprot_identifier`:

- Only **33.3%** of bakta's 17.6M distinct UniRef50 IDs exist in the BERDL UniProt subset
- Of the matched IDs, the bridge reaches: RefSeq (71%), OrthoDB (46%), STRING (40%), KEGG (36%)
- The bridge table lacks GO, EC, InterPro, and Pfam — **importing full UniProt would unlock these**

### Key takeaways

1. **Bakta and eggNOG are complementary**, not competing — union raises "any function" from ~70% to 77.3%
2. **GO terms are bakta's clear win** — 2× eggNOG's coverage (15% vs 7.4%)
3. **EggNOG dominates for enrichment annotations** (COG, KEGG, Pfam) due to orthology transfer
4. **Bakta's UniRef50 links are the biggest new asset** — 79.2% coverage, enabling future UniProt bridging
5. **AMR annotations are unique to bakta** — 83K clusters with AMRFinderPlus hits

## Background

The `kbase_ke_pangenome` database has 1B gene cluster representatives but only eggNOG-based functional annotations. This reannotation adds Bakta's broader annotation pipeline:

- **UniProt lookups**: UPS (UniParc), IPS (InterPro), PSC/PSCC (UniRef clusters)
- **Pfam domain annotation**: HMM-based domain hits with coverage metrics
- **AMR detection**: AMRFinderPlus with identity/coverage scores
- **Cross-references**: Links to external databases (SO, UniRef, KEGG, COG, GO, EC, Pfam)
- **Physical properties**: Molecular weight and isoelectric point

### Software versions

- bakta: 1.12.0
- bakta DB: v6.0
- AMRFinderPlus: 4.2.7 (DB: 2026-01-21.1)
- HMMER: 3.4

### Key files on NERSC pscratch (ephemeral — may be purged)

- Chunks: `/pscratch/sd/p/psdehal/bakta_reannotation/chunks_2M/chunk_000.fasta` through `chunk_043.fasta`
- Raw results: `/pscratch/sd/p/psdehal/bakta_reannotation/results_2M/chunk_*/`
- Per-chunk tables: `/pscratch/sd/p/psdehal/bakta_reannotation/tables/chunk_*/`
- Final combined tables: `/pscratch/sd/p/psdehal/bakta_reannotation/tables/final/`

### Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `extract_bakta_tables.py` | Parse bakta TSV output into normalized tables per chunk |
| `combine_tables.py` | Concatenate per-chunk tables into final combined files |
| `ingest_bakta.py` | Original upload + ingest script (paths point to NERSC) |
| `run_ingest.py` | Final ingest script used for Delta Lake import (reads from MinIO user staging) |
| `compare_bakta_eggnog.py` | Spark-optimized comparison of bakta vs eggNOG coverage |
| `bakta_reannotation.json` | Ingestion config with table schemas |

### Ingestion notes

- Tenant is `kbase` (not `kbase_ke`) — see pitfalls doc
- `data_lakehouse_ingest` auto-prepends tenant name to the dataset as a namespace prefix, so `dataset="ke_pangenome"` with `tenant="kbase"` produces `kbase_ke_pangenome`
- Ingestion of all 4 tables took ~20 minutes on JupyterHub Spark
- Staging TSVs on MinIO were deleted after successful ingestion
