# BERDL Local Ingest Skill

## Overview

Ingests a local dataset into the BERDL Lakehouse as a new tenant namespace, running entirely
from a local machine via the off-cluster proxy chain. Detects source format, parses schema,
exports data if needed, then executes a **two-phase ingest**:

1. **Upload** — all source files uploaded to MinIO bronze in full before any ingest begins.
2. **Ingest** — Delta tables written to silver. Tables larger than `CHUNK_TARGET_GB` (default 20 GB)
   are streamed from the local file in line-count chunks to avoid Spark session timeouts.
   A JSONL progress log is written to MinIO after every chunk so interrupted jobs can resume.

## Preconditions

1. `KBASE_AUTH_TOKEN` set in environment or `.env`.
2. **Ingest packages installed**: run `bash scripts/bootstrap_ingest.sh` (requires `.venv-berdl` from `bootstrap_client.sh`).
3. **SSH tunnels on ports 1337 and 1338 must be running** (user must start these —
   see `berdl-query/references/proxy-setup.md`). pproxy (:8123) and JupyterHub
   server are started automatically by the notebook if not already running.
4. **`mc` configured**: `~/.mc/config.json` must have a `berdl-minio` alias. Run `bash scripts/configure_mc.sh --berdl-proxy` if not set.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Ask for source directory

Ask the user for the path to their source data directory. The directory should contain:

- One `.parquet` file per table — Parquet files are read natively by Spark with embedded schema (preferred format), **or**
- A `.db` / `.sqlite` file — SQLite database (tables exported to TSV automatically), **or**
- One `.tsv` or `.csv` file per table — used directly, no conversion needed
- Optionally a `.sql` file with `CREATE TABLE` statements — used to map column types to Spark SQL types for CSV/TSV; all columns default to `STRING` without it (not needed for Parquet)

Inspect the directory and report what was found before continuing:

```bash
ls -lh <DATA_DIR>
```

**SQL dump only:** If the user has a `.sql` dump with INSERT statements but no `.db`, restore it first:
```bash
sqlite3 /tmp/<dataset>.db < <dump>.sql
# then move the .db into the source directory
```

### Step 2: Choose tenant

List existing tenants:

```bash
source .venv-berdl/bin/activate
python scripts/run_sql.py --berdl-proxy --query "SHOW DATABASES"
```

Present the results. Tenants are the unique prefixes before the first `_` in each database name (e.g. `kescience`, `nmdc`, `gtdb`). Ask the user to pick an existing tenant or provide a new name.

### Step 3: Choose dataset name and write mode

Ask for the dataset name. Suggest `DATA_DIR.name` (the directory's basename) as a default.
Check whether the namespace already exists:

```bash
python scripts/run_sql.py --berdl-proxy --query "SHOW DATABASES LIKE '<tenant>_<dataset>'"
```

The final namespace will be `{tenant}_{dataset}`.

**If the namespace already exists**, list its current tables and row counts, then ask the user:

- **Overwrite** — existing Delta tables are replaced. Use `MODE = "overwrite"`.
- **Append** — new rows are added to existing tables. Use `MODE = "append"`.

If the user chooses append, confirm which tables they want to append to. For any table to skip,
note it now — the user can set `"enabled": false` in the per-table config or skip the relevant
ingest step in the notebook.

### Step 4: Generate, configure, and run the ingest notebook

Copy the reference template into the source directory, named after the dataset:

```bash
cp .claude/skills/berdl-ingest/references/ingest.ipynb <DATA_DIR>/<dataset>_ingest.ipynb
```

Edit the configuration cell (cell id `b0000003`) in the copied notebook, replacing the
`{PLACEHOLDER}` values. Use the **absolute path** for `DATA_DIR`:

```python
DATA_DIR        = Path("/absolute/path/to/<source directory>")
TENANT          = "<chosen tenant>"
DATASET         = "<chosen dataset>"    # or None to use DATA_DIR.name
BUCKET          = "cdm-lake"
MODE            = "overwrite"           # "overwrite" or "append" — determined in Step 3
CHUNK_TARGET_GB = 20                    # tables above this are ingested in chunks
CHUNKED_INGEST  = True                  # False = force single-batch (not recommended for large tables)
CONFIRMED       = False                 # set True after reviewing the pre-flight plan
```

**Run the notebook through the Pre-flight plan cell** (do not execute the full notebook yet):

```bash
source .venv-berdl/bin/activate
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace \
    --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=120 \
    --ExecutePreprocessor.raise_on_iopub_timeout=False \
    <DATA_DIR>/<dataset>_ingest.ipynb 2>&1 | tail -5
```

The Pre-flight cell will raise a `RuntimeError` (intentionally) when `CONFIRMED = False`,
halting execution after printing the plan. Read the plan output from the notebook cell outputs:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
nb = json.load(open('<DATA_DIR>/<dataset>_ingest.ipynb'))
for cell in nb.get('cells', []):
    for o in cell.get('outputs', []):
        if 'text' in o: print(''.join(o['text']))
"
```

**Review the pre-flight plan with the user.** It shows:

- **Step 1**: each table's file size and total upload size
- **Step 2**: for each table — single ingest or number of chunks × lines per chunk

Once the user confirms the plan looks correct, set `CONFIRMED = True` in the config cell,
then execute the full notebook:

```bash
source .venv-berdl/bin/activate
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace \
    --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=-1 \
    <DATA_DIR>/<dataset>_ingest.ipynb
```

**What the notebook does:**

1. Counts lines in each source file and calculates per-table chunk sizes
2. Prints the pre-flight plan and blocks until `CONFIRMED = True`
3. Uploads all files to MinIO bronze (full files, no chunking at this stage)
4. Loads any existing progress log from MinIO (enables resume on restart)
5. For each table:
   - **≤ CHUNK_TARGET_GB**: ingests via `ingest()` in one shot
   - **> CHUNK_TARGET_GB**: streams the local file with `pandas.read_csv(chunksize=N)`,
     writes each chunk to Delta via `spark.createDataFrame()`, logs progress to MinIO after each chunk
6. Verifies final row counts against expected line counts

**Resuming an interrupted ingest:** If the notebook fails mid-ingest (e.g. Spark session timeout),
simply re-run the ingest cell. The progress log is loaded at startup — already-completed chunks
and tables are skipped automatically.

**Disabling chunked ingest:** Set `CHUNKED_INGEST = False` to force all tables through the
single-batch `ingest()` pipeline regardless of size. Only use this for datasets where all
tables are small enough to ingest without timeout risk.

### Step 5: Confirm results

Report to the user:
- Namespace created: `{tenant}_{dataset}`
- Tables ingested and row counts (from notebook verification cell output)
- Bronze path: `s3a://cdm-lake/tenant-general-warehouse/{tenant}/datasets/{dataset}/`
- Silver path: `s3a://cdm-lake/tenant-sql-warehouse/{tenant}/{tenant}_{dataset}.db`
- Progress log: `s3a://cdm-lake/tenant-general-warehouse/{tenant}/datasets/{dataset}/_ingest_progress.jsonl`

Confirm row counts match expected line counts. If there is a mismatch, the progress log
records `start_line`, `end_line`, and `rows_written` per chunk — the user can query the last
ingested row in Delta and compare against the logged line range to locate the gap.

## Scripts

- `scripts/bootstrap_client.sh`: create `.venv-berdl` and install base query packages.
- `scripts/bootstrap_ingest.sh`: install ingest-specific packages on top of `.venv-berdl`.

## References

- `references/ingest.ipynb`: notebook template — copied into `<DATA_DIR>/` and configured for each ingest job.
- `berdl-query/references/proxy-setup.md`: SSH tunnel and pproxy setup for off-cluster access.

## Progress Log Format

The progress log is a JSONL file at `s3a://cdm-lake/{BRONZE_PREFIX}/_ingest_progress.jsonl`.
Each line is one JSON object. There are two entry types:

**Chunk entry** (written after each chunk or single-table ingest):
```json
{"table": "my_table", "chunk": 2, "start_line": 4000001, "end_line": 6000000,
 "rows_written": 2000000, "rows_cumulative": 6000000,
 "status": "ingested", "timestamp": "2026-02-23T14:32:00Z"}
```

**Completion entry** (written when all chunks for a table are done):
```json
{"table": "my_table", "status": "complete",
 "total_rows": 6000000, "total_chunks": 3, "timestamp": "2026-02-23T15:10:00Z"}
```

`start_line` and `end_line` are 1-indexed data line numbers (header excluded). If a row
count mismatch is found, use these to cross-check against the Delta table's last row.

## Error Handling

- **Ingest packages missing**: run `bash scripts/bootstrap_ingest.sh`.
- **SSH tunnels down (ports 1337/1338)**: notebook will raise and print the exact ssh
  command to run. Start the tunnel(s), then re-run the initialization cell.
- **pproxy not running (:8123)**: started automatically by the notebook.
- **JupyterHub server not running**: spawned automatically via `berdl-remote`. Requires
  `KBASE_AUTH_TOKEN` in environment or `.env`.
- **Spark session timeout mid-chunk**: health check before each chunk detects this
  automatically. The notebook reconnects and retries the failed chunk. Progress
  already written to MinIO is preserved.
- **Spark session timeout limit (1 hour)**: cluster admin task — request BERDL
  administrators to increase Spark Connect session timeout to 10 hours.
- **Namespace already exists**: confirm with user before re-ingesting; `MODE = "overwrite"` on
  the first chunk will replace the existing Delta table.
- **Row count mismatch**: inspect the progress log for `start_line`/`end_line` of the last
  chunk, and check the quarantine path at `{SILVER_BASE}/quarantine/` for rejected rows.
- **Schema type errors**: recheck `.sql` parsing output in the schema cell and adjust column
  types in the config cell before re-running the ingest cell.
- **`createDataFrame` size errors over Spark Connect**: if a chunk is too large for the gRPC
  channel, reduce `CHUNK_TARGET_GB` (e.g. to 10 or 5) and re-run. The progress log will
  resume from the last completed chunk.

## Safety Rules

1. Never print or log MinIO `secretKey` values.
2. Do not set `MODE = "overwrite"` for an existing namespace without explicit user confirmation.
3. Do not set `CONFIRMED = True` on behalf of the user — always present the pre-flight plan
   and wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding.
4. Do not commit the notebook with credentials visible in cell outputs.

## Pitfall Detection

When you encounter errors, unexpected results, retry cycles, or data surprises during this task, follow the pitfall-capture protocol. Read `.claude/skills/pitfall-capture/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions to determine whether the issue should be added to `docs/pitfalls.md`.
