# Polyhydroxybutyrate Granule Formation Pathways: Distribution Across Clades and Environmental Selection

## Research Question

How are polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) granule-forming pathways distributed across bacterial clades and environments, and does this distribution support the hypothesis that carbon storage granules are most beneficial in temporally variable feast/famine environments?

## Status

Complete — see [Report](REPORT.md) for findings. H1a (environmental enrichment) supported; H1b (niche breadth) confounded by genome size; H1c (NMDC cross-validation) supported; H1d (subclade selection) partially supported.

## Overview

PHB is one of the most widely distributed carbon storage strategies in bacteria, yet systematic pan-bacterial surveys of its distribution across both phylogeny and environment are lacking. We use the BERDL pangenome (293K genomes, 27K species) to map PHB pathway completeness across the bacterial tree using eggNOG annotations (KEGG KOs, PFam domains), then correlate with environmental metadata (NCBI isolation source, AlphaEarth embeddings) and NMDC metagenomic data (abiotic features, taxonomic profiles). We test the classical feast/famine hypothesis: that PHB pathways are enriched in clades and environments with temporally variable carbon availability.
