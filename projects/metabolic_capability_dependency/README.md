# Metabolic Capability vs Metabolic Dependency

## Research Question

Just because a bacterium's genome encodes a complete metabolic pathway (metabolic *capability*), does the organism actually depend on it? Can we distinguish genomic capability from functional dependency using experimental fitness data?

## Status

Complete — see [Report](REPORT.md) for findings

## Overview

Metabolic pathway prediction from genomes assumes that pathway completeness implies biological relevance. However, many "complete" pathways may be latent capabilities — present but unexpressed, or expressed but functionally redundant with alternative pathways. This project integrates genome-scale metabolic predictions (GapMind pathways) with genome-wide fitness profiling (RB-TnSeq from Fitness Browser) to classify pathways as **active dependencies** (complete + fitness-important), **latent capabilities** (complete + fitness-neutral), or **missing** (incomplete).

For ~30 organisms with both fitness data and pangenome links, we:
1. Map GapMind pathway predictions to fitness-tested genes
2. Classify each predicted-complete pathway by aggregated fitness importance
3. Test if "latent capabilities" predict future gene loss (Black Queen Hypothesis)
4. Identify metabolic ecotypes within species based on pathway heterogeneity

## Reproduction

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.11+
- Access to BERDL JupyterHub (for NB01 data extraction)
- Prior project cached data (see Data Sources above)

**Pipeline:**

1. **NB01** (JupyterHub + Spark): Extract GapMind pathway data and aggregate to genome level → `data/gapmind_genome_pathways.csv` ✓ *complete*
2. **NB02** (JupyterHub + Spark): Query FB organism metadata, SEED annotations, fitness aggregates, and essential genes; compute per-pathway fitness metrics using SEED subsystem proxy
3. **NB03** (local): Classify pathways as active dependency / latent capability / intermediate
4. **NB04** (JupyterHub + Spark for pangenome query, then local): Test Black Queen Hypothesis
5. **NB05** (local, Spark optional for env metadata): Identify metabolic ecotypes within species

**Note on NB02 approach**: This project does not depend on `conservation_vs_fitness/data/fb_pangenome_link.tsv`.
Instead, NB02 maps GapMind pathways to Fitness Browser genes via SEED subsystem annotations,
and matches FB organisms to GapMind species clades using NCBI taxonomy IDs from `kbase_ke_pangenome.gtdb_metadata`.

```bash
cd projects/metabolic_capability_dependency
pip install -r requirements.txt

# All notebooks run on BERDL JupyterHub (NB01, NB02, NB04 use Spark; NB03, NB05 run locally)
# NB05 can run independently of NB02-04 (uses only NB01 data)
```
