# Metal-Specific vs General Stress Genes in the Metal Fitness Atlas

## Research Question
Among the 12,838 metal-important genes identified by the Metal Fitness Atlas, which are specifically required for metal tolerance vs general stress survival — and do the metal-specific genes show the expected accessory-genome enrichment?

## Status
Completed — 54% of metal-important genes are metal-specific (sick rate <5% under non-metal conditions), but these remain 88% core-enriched. The core genome robustness model holds even after controlling for specificity. YebC is the most metal-specific novel candidate (58%).

## Overview
The Metal Fitness Atlas found that metal-important genes are 87.4% core (OR=2.08), the opposite of the expected accessory enrichment for metal resistance. This project tests whether the core enrichment is driven by general stress genes (cell envelope, DNA repair) that are needed for many stresses, not just metals. By comparing each metal-important gene's fitness across all 5,945 non-metal experiments in the Fitness Browser, we classify genes as metal-specific, shared-stress, or generally sick. If metal-specific genes are accessory-enriched, this resolves the paradox and identifies the true metal resistance determinants.
