# Fitness Effects vs Conservation -- Quantitative Analysis

## Research Question

Is there a continuous gradient from essential genes (core) to dispensable genes (accessory) across the full fitness spectrum, and what does the fitness landscape of novel genes look like?

## Status

Completed -- 16pp fitness-conservation gradient established; core genes are more functionally active, not more inert.

## Overview

This project moves beyond the binary essential/non-essential classification to ask quantitative questions about how fitness importance relates to pangenome conservation. It reveals a clear gradient from essential genes (82% core) to always-neutral genes (66% core), shows that fitness breadth predicts conservation, and finds that core genes are MORE likely to be burdens and have condition-specific effects -- suggesting they are the most functionally active part of the genome.
