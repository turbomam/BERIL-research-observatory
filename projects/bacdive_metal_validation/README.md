# BacDive Isolation Environment × Metal Tolerance Prediction

## Research Question
Do bacteria isolated from metal-contaminated environments have higher predicted metal tolerance scores than bacteria from uncontaminated environments?

## Status
Completed — heavy metal contamination isolates have significantly higher metal tolerance scores (d=+1.00, p=0.006). Signal is dose-dependent: heavy metal > waste > contamination > industrial. Holds within Pseudomonadota and Actinomycetota after phylogenetic stratification.

## Overview
The Metal Fitness Atlas scored 27,702 pangenome species for metal tolerance using a genome-based functional signature. This project validates those predictions against BacDive's isolation source metadata for 97K strains. By linking BacDive genome accessions to pangenome species, we test whether organisms from heavy-metal contamination sites, industrial environments, and waste/sludge sites have higher predicted metal tolerance than organisms from host-associated or uncontaminated environments.
