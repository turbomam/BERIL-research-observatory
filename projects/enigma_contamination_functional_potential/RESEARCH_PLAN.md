# Research Plan: Contamination Gradient vs Functional Potential in ENIGMA Communities

## Research Question

Do high-contamination Oak Ridge groundwater communities show enrichment for taxa with higher inferred stress-related functional potential compared with low-contamination communities?

## Hypothesis

- **H0**: After controlling for sampling depth and site structure, contamination level is not associated with inferred stress-related functional potential in community composition.
- **H1**: Higher contamination is associated with higher inferred stress-related functional potential in community composition.

## Literature Context

Prior BERIL work established that ENIGMA CORAL supports field ecology analysis and that several genera correlate with uranium abundance (`projects/lab_field_ecology/`). This project extends from genus-abundance correlation to functional inference by mapping taxa observed across contamination gradients to functional annotations in BERDL pangenome resources.

## Approach

1. Build a contamination-indexed sample set from ENIGMA geochemistry.
2. Build community composition matrices for overlapping samples.
3. Map ENIGMA taxa to BERDL pangenome taxa (NCBI taxid and/or normalized taxon name).
4. Summarize stress-relevant functional annotation signals per taxon.
5. Aggregate functional potential per sample and test association with contamination.
6. Run sensitivity checks for mapping ambiguity and low-abundance taxa.

## Data Sources

| Source | Table/File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| ENIGMA geochemistry | `enigma_coral.ddt_brick0000010` | Per-sample contaminant concentrations (uranium + co-metals) |
| ENIGMA community counts | `enigma_coral.ddt_brick0000459` | Community abundance matrix |
| ENIGMA taxonomy mapping | `enigma_coral.ddt_brick0000454` | ASV-to-taxon linkage |
| ENIGMA sample metadata | `enigma_coral.sdt_sample`, `enigma_coral.sdt_community`, `enigma_coral.sdt_location` | Site/sample joins and location covariates |
| Pangenome taxonomy | `kbase_ke_pangenome.gtdb_taxonomy_r214v1`, `kbase_ke_pangenome.gtdb_species_clade`, `kbase_ke_pangenome.genome` | Taxonomic bridge into functional annotations |
| Pangenome function | `kbase_ke_pangenome.eggnog_mapper_annotations` (+ cluster linkage tables as needed) | Functional potential features |

## Query Strategy

### NB01: ENIGMA Extraction and QC (Spark)

- Reproduce overlap extraction pattern used in prior ENIGMA projects.
- Validate current row counts and key join cardinalities.
- Produce clean exports:
  - `data/geochemistry_sample_matrix.tsv`
  - `data/community_taxon_counts.tsv`
  - `data/sample_location_metadata.tsv`

### NB02: Taxonomy Bridge and Functional Feature Build (Spark)

- Build taxon bridge from ENIGMA taxa to pangenome taxa.
- Start with conservative mappings (exact or high-confidence normalized matches).
- Create per-taxon feature table with stress-relevant annotation summaries.
- Export:
  - `data/taxon_bridge.tsv`
  - `data/taxon_functional_features.tsv`

### NB03: Functional Potential vs Contamination (Local/Spark)

- Define contamination index (e.g., uranium z-score, or PCA over metal concentrations).
- Compute site-level weighted functional potential scores from community abundances.
- Fit models:
  - rank correlation
  - robust linear model (with covariates where available)
  - permutation test for label robustness
- Export:
  - `data/site_functional_scores.tsv`
  - `data/model_results.tsv`

## Analysis Plan

### Notebook 01: `01_enigma_extraction_qc.ipynb`
- **Goal**: verify ENIGMA joins and extract analysis-ready site/taxon matrices.
- **Expected output**: overlap sample inventory and contamination variables.

### Notebook 02: `02_taxonomy_bridge_functional_features.ipynb`
- **Goal**: map ENIGMA taxa to pangenome and build annotation-derived stress features.
- **Expected output**: taxon bridge diagnostics and feature table.

### Notebook 03: `03_contamination_functional_models.ipynb`
- **Goal**: test H0/H1 with contamination-functional association models.
- **Expected output**: effect sizes, significance, and diagnostic plots.

## Expected Outcomes

- **If H1 supported**: contaminated sites are functionally shifted toward stress-related signatures.
- **If H0 not rejected**: contamination may structure taxonomy without detectable functional-shift signal under current mapping resolution.
- **Potential confounders**: sparse taxonomy resolution, compositional effects, incomplete taxon-to-pangenome mapping, temporal heterogeneity.

## Known Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: ENIGMA taxon labels may not map cleanly to pangenome entities.
  - **Mitigation**: enforce confidence tiers; run analyses on strict and relaxed mapping sets.
- **Risk**: string-typed numeric fields in ENIGMA bricks.
  - **Mitigation**: explicit CAST in Spark SQL; log parsing failure rates.
- **Risk**: sparse/zero-inflated abundance vectors.
  - **Mitigation**: prevalence filtering and compositional robustness checks.

- **v1 (2026-02-15)**: Initial plan for ENIGMA contamination-functional potential project.
- **v2 (2026-02-15)**: Added Phase C notebook scaffold (`01_enigma_extraction_qc.ipynb`, `02_taxonomy_bridge_functional_features.ipynb`, `03_contamination_functional_models.ipynb`) with extraction/QC, taxonomy bridge, and modeling workflow placeholders.
- **v3 (2026-02-15)**: Replaced placeholders with concrete extraction, taxonomy-bridge, feature engineering, and modeling code; standardized on built-in `get_spark_session()` for BERDL notebook execution.
- **v4 (2026-02-15)**: Executed NB01-NB03 end-to-end; optimized NB01 to aggregate ASV counts in Spark before collection (avoids driver OOM) and updated NB03 to use `scipy.stats.linregress` due environment-level `statsmodels` import failure.
- **v5 (2026-02-16)**: Added strict-vs-relaxed mapping-mode sensitivity analysis and diagnostic visualizations (contamination distribution, mapping coverage); re-executed NB02-NB03 and refreshed outputs.
- **v6 (2026-02-16)**: Added `species_proxy_unique_genus` sensitivity mode (unique genus->single GTDB clade) to approximate higher-resolution bridging under genus-only ENIGMA taxonomy; re-executed NB02-NB03 and refreshed outputs.
- **v7 (2026-02-16)**: Addressed high-priority review rigor items in NB03: predeclared confirmatory vs exploratory analyses, added global BH-FDR q-values across all reported p-values, and added community-fraction robustness models/stratified tests from `sdt_community_name`; re-executed NB03 and refreshed outputs.
- **v8 (2026-02-16)**: Addressed medium-priority robustness suggestions in NB03: added bootstrap confidence intervals for key effect sizes, contamination-index variant sensitivity (`composite`, `uranium_only`, `top3_var_metals`, `pca1_metals`), mapped-coverage decile diagnostics, and explicit model-family sample-count tables; re-executed NB03 and refreshed outputs.
