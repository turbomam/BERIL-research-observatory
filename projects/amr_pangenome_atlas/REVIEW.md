# Review: Pan-Bacterial AMR Gene Landscape

## Summary

This is a mature, well-executed project that delivers a pangenome-scale survey of antimicrobial resistance genes across 27,690 bacterial species. The study integrates the `bakta_amr` table (83,008 AMRFinderPlus hits) with pangenome conservation flags, GTDB taxonomy, NCBI isolation metadata, AlphaEarth environmental embeddings, and Fitness Browser fitness scores — a genuinely multi-dimensional analysis. All six stated hypotheses are tested with appropriate statistical methods, the notebooks are fully executed with saved outputs, and the README → RESEARCH_PLAN → notebooks → REPORT documentation chain is coherent and complete. The central finding — a clear intrinsic-versus-acquired AMR dichotomy expressed at pan-bacterial scale, with beta-lactamases sitting 2.2× above the core genome baseline while mobile resistance elements are entirely accessory — is scientifically novel and well-supported. The main areas for improvement are minor: one potential classification issue in NB05, a modest gap in figure coverage for the fitness analysis (NB06), and a few places where the REPORT could be tightened with effect-size summaries and explicit cross-notebook citation.

## Methodology

**Research question clarity**: All six hypotheses in RESEARCH_PLAN.md are specific and testable. H1–H6 are independently addressable from available BERDL tables, and the analysis plan maps each hypothesis to concrete SQL queries and statistical tests. This is exemplary hypothesis-driven design.

**Approach soundness**: Each analytical step is appropriate for the data:
- H1 uses chi-squared + Wilcoxon signed-rank on paired species data, avoiding Simpson's paradox by controlling for species composition.
- H2 uses within-phylum Spearman correlations (10 phyla tested separately), correctly separating phylogenetic structure from pangenome openness effects.
- H3 uses COG category enrichment against an 86M-cluster baseline, not just internal AMR proportions — this is the right denominator.
- H4 uses Kruskal-Wallis (appropriate for non-normal multi-group comparison) then Spearman for the continuous AlphaEarth diversity predictor.
- H6 uses DIAMOND at 100% identity to link AMR clusters to Fitness Browser genes, which is methodologically conservative and appropriate for measuring known-gene fitness effects.

**Data sources**: All source tables are explicitly named (database + table name) and row counts are stated. The provenance chain from `bakta_amr` → `gene_cluster` → `bakta_annotations` → `eggnog_mapper_annotations` is transparent.

**One methodological concern**: NB05 classifies species by majority-vote over NCBI `isolation_source` strings (27 keywords → 7 broad categories). The keyword list covers the obvious cases, but "Other/Unclassified" environment accounts for ~38% of species-level classification. The REPORT acknowledges sampling bias but does not quantify how many of the 14,723 AMR-carrying species are in the "Other/Unclassified" bin. If clinical species are over-represented in the unclassified remainder, the 2.7× AMR enrichment in clinical versus soil could be modestly inflated. A brief sensitivity analysis (e.g., restricting to the 5 well-classified categories) would strengthen the claim.

**Reproducibility**: Excellent. The README contains a `## Reproduction` section listing all seven notebooks in run order, flagging which ones require a live Spark session and which can run locally from cached CSVs. Expected runtimes are given. A `requirements.txt` lists pinned minimum versions of all five dependencies. A researcher could reproduce this analysis on any BERDL JupyterHub node without additional instructions.

## Code Quality

**SQL correctness**: Queries are well-formed throughout. Joins use appropriate keys (`cluster_id`, `species_id`, `genome_id`) and filter conditions are applied before aggregation. The incremental approach — dump a manageable AMR-joined table in NB01, then join from the cached CSV in downstream notebooks — is architecturally sound and avoids redundant 132M-row scans.

**Pitfall adherence**: The project demonstrates strong awareness of documented BERDL pitfalls:
- `ncbi_env` is queried in EAV format and correctly pivoted in NB05 (`attribute = 'isolation_source'`).
- Species IDs with `--` delimiter are handled via exact equality joins, not string splitting.
- Large cross-joins (AMR × AlphaEarth embeddings at 2,684 species × 64 dimensions) are chunked to stay within gRPC message limits.
- The COG enrichment baseline in NB04 correctly queries the full `bakta_annotations` table rather than materializing a second large join.

**Statistical methods**: All tests are appropriate for the data type and distribution (non-parametric tests for skewed AMR count distributions, chi-squared for categorical conservation class comparisons). Effect sizes (odds ratios, Spearman ρ) are reported alongside p-values throughout. Multiple hypothesis testing is not formally corrected, but the p-values across all main tests are so extreme (many < 1e-100) that Bonferroni correction would not change the conclusions — this could be noted explicitly in the REPORT.

**Notebook organization**: All seven notebooks follow a clean setup → query → analysis → visualization structure. Cell count is lean (2–9 cells per notebook), which keeps logic focused. NB07's synthesis is appropriately brief, delegating detail to earlier notebooks.

**Minor code issue**: In NB06, the DIAMOND-based linking logic filters `percent_identity = 100` to find AMR cluster representatives in the FB link table. This is correct for avoiding false matches, but the 100%-identity threshold may miss closely related homologs (e.g., variants differing by a single synonymous substitution). The REPORT correctly frames this as a conservative estimate, but the threshold choice deserves a one-line comment in the code cell.

## Findings Assessment

**H1 (Conservation)**: Finding fully supported. The OR=0.494 and paired Wilcoxon p=1.1e-130 across 4,252 species constitute very strong evidence. The mechanism-level breakdown (beta-lactamases 54.9% core vs. regulatory genes 6.5% core) adds important nuance and is the project's most interesting sub-finding.

**H2 (Phylogenetic Distribution)**: Finding well-supported. The Gammaproteobacteria concentration (45% of all AMR clusters) and near-zero global openness correlation (ρ=0.006) vs. significant within-phylum correlations cleanly partition phylogenetic signal from ecological signal.

**H3 (Functional Context)**: COG V enrichment (7.05×) validates the AMRFinderPlus annotations as bona fide defense genes, not annotation noise. COG P enrichment (1.93×) for inorganic ion transport is an interesting secondary finding; the identification of mercury/arsenic resistance families as drivers is a concrete, checkable claim. Partially supports the original hypothesis (enrichment near defense/transport, but no spatial co-localization analysis was attempted).

**H4 (Environmental Signal)**: Finding strongly supported. The Kruskal-Wallis result (H=440, p=7.0e-93) and the AlphaEarth niche-breadth predictor (ρ=0.466) are independent lines of evidence converging on the same conclusion. The additional finding that clinical AMR is *less* core (30.8%) than soil AMR (58.1%) is particularly strong — it distinguishes the mechanism (horizontal acquisition) from a simpler confound (clinical genomes having larger accessory genomes in general).

**H5 (Annotation Depth)**: Zero Pfam coverage for AMR clusters is a notable empirical finding, not just an absence of dark matter. The REPORT's explanation (non-overlapping HMM databases) is plausible and worth flagging as a downstream consequence: structural annotation pipelines that rely on Pfam hits will systematically miss this class of genes.

**H6 (Fitness Cost)**: The finding (AMR genes slightly *less* costly than baseline, p=3.7e-6) is reported accurately, but the REPORT's interpretation deserves one additional sentence: the Fitness Browser organisms skew toward environmental isolates where intrinsic resistance genes predominate; the result may not generalize to recently acquired mobile resistance elements in clinical strains. This limitation is hinted at but not stated explicitly.

**Incomplete or placeholder content**: None found. All analysis sections in REPORT.md are fully written; no "TODO" or placeholder cells exist in any notebook.

**Figures and labeled axes**: All 17 figures are present. Axis labels and legends appear in figure-generating code cells. The synthesis figure (fig1_amr_overview.png) covers conservation class, species distribution, top genes, and mechanism breakdown — a reasonable four-panel overview. One gap: NB06 (fitness analysis) has no standalone figure file; the fitness distribution is only described in text output. Adding a `amr_fitness_by_mechanism.png` would give this analysis the same visual documentation as the other five hypotheses.

## Suggestions

1. **(Critical) Add fitness distribution figure for NB06.** — **RESOLVED**: `figures/amr_fitness_distribution.png` already existed at review time (2-panel: AMR vs non-AMR density plot + fitness by mechanism box plot). Reviewer oversight.

2. **(Important) Quantify the "Other/Unclassified" environment bin in NB05.** — **RESOLVED**: Added to REPORT.md Finding #5: 7,838/14,723 AMR species (53.2%) received a well-classified environment; 46.8% fell into Other/Unknown due to sparse/inconsistent NCBI BioSample metadata. Kruskal-Wallis test restricted to well-classified species.

3. **(Important) Add an explicit note on the NB06 100%-identity threshold.** — **RESOLVED**: Added to REPORT.md Finding #6: notes the conservative threshold, potential undercounting of allelic variants, and the FB organism bias toward environmental strains where intrinsic resistance predominates. Also added to Limitations section.

4. **(Moderate) Note the absence of multiple-testing correction in the REPORT.** — **RESOLVED**: Added to Limitations section: primary test p-values are extreme (many < 1e-100), correction would not change conclusions, per-gene/per-phylum tests are exploratory.

5. **(Moderate) Clarify the mechanism classification method in REPORT.md.** — **RESOLVED**: Added paragraph after mechanism classification table explaining keyword-based approach, the 22.2% Other/Unclassified gap, and suggesting CARD ARO mapping via `bakta_db_xrefs` as future work.

6. **(Moderate) Cross-reference notebooks in the REPORT.** — **RESOLVED**: Already present at review time — each finding subsection ends with `*(Notebook: filename.ipynb)*`. Reviewer oversight.

7. **(Minor) Add a `data/README.md` describing all 10 CSV output files.** — **RESOLVED**: Created `data/README.md` with full data dictionary: file name, row count, producing notebook, and column descriptions for all 10 CSVs.

8. **(Minor) Consider adding `spark_connect_remote` and `berdl_remote` to `requirements.txt`.** — **RESOLVED**: Added `scikit-learn>=1.3`, `spark-connect-remote`, and `berdl-remote` (with comment noting internal PyPI requirement).
