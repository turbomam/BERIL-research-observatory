# Pan-Bacterial AMR Gene Landscape

## Research Question

What is the distribution, conservation, phylogenetic structure, functional context, and environmental association of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes across 27,000 bacterial species pangenomes?

## Status

Complete — see [Report](REPORT.md) for findings. All 7 notebooks executed with saved outputs.

## Overview

The BERDL pangenome collection contains AMRFinderPlus annotations (via Bakta v1.12.0) for 83,008 gene cluster representatives across 132M total clusters in 27,690 species. This project conducts the first comprehensive, pangenome-aware survey of AMR genes at this scale, examining:

1. **Conservation**: Are AMR genes core, accessory, or singleton? How does this compare to the genome-wide baseline?
2. **Phylogeny**: Which lineages are AMR hotspots? How does AMR density scale with pangenome size and openness?
3. **Mechanisms**: What resistance mechanisms dominate (efflux, target modification, enzymatic inactivation)? Which are universal vs lineage-restricted?
4. **Functional context**: What metabolic functions and COG categories co-occur with AMR genes?
5. **Environment**: Do host-associated and clinical isolates carry different AMR profiles than environmental ones?
6. **Annotation depth**: How many AMR clusters lack other functional annotations ("AMR-only" dark matter)?
7. **Fitness cost**: Do AMR genes impose measurable fitness costs in lab conditions?
