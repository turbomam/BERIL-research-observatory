# Co-fitness Predicts Co-inheritance in Bacterial Pangenomes

## Research Question

Do genes with correlated fitness profiles (co-fit) tend to co-occur in the same genomes across a species' pangenome? Does functional coupling constrain which genes are gained and lost together?

## Status

Completed -- pairwise co-fitness weakly but consistently predicts co-occurrence (delta phi=+0.003, 7/9 organisms positive, p=1.66e-29), with ICA fitness modules showing stronger co-inheritance (delta=+0.053, 49/195 modules significant, accessory modules 73% significant).

## Overview

This project tests whether lab-measured functional coupling (co-fitness from RB-TnSeq) predicts genome-level co-inheritance (co-occurrence in pangenomes) across 11 bacterial species. It builds on `module_conservation` (modules are 86% core) and `fitness_modules` (48 accessory modules exist). Phi coefficients (binary Pearson correlation) measure co-occurrence across genomes, compared against prevalence-matched random pairs. See [RESEARCH_PLAN.md](RESEARCH_PLAN.md) for the detailed hypothesis and analysis plan.

Key results: Pairwise co-fitness weakly but consistently predicts co-occurrence (7/9 organisms positive), though the effect size is small. Multi-gene ICA modules show a substantially stronger co-inheritance signal, especially the 48 accessory modules -- functionally coherent gene groups that travel together through the pangenome (73% significant). See [REPORT.md](REPORT.md) for full findings and interpretation.

## Approach

1. **Genome x gene cluster presence matrices**: For 11 target species, extract which gene clusters are present in which genomes from the KBase pangenome database
2. **Phi coefficient (co-occurrence)**: For each pair of gene clusters, compute phi = Pearson correlation of binary presence/absence vectors across genomes
3. **Co-fitness pairs**: Use top-20 co-fitness partners per gene from Fitness Browser `cofit` table as the test set
4. **Prevalence gradient**: Analyze phi as a continuous function of mean prevalence (not binary core/aux), maximizing statistical power
5. **Controls**: (a) Matched random pairs at same prevalence, (b) Exclude adjacent genes (operon control), (c) Stratify by phylogenetic distance
