# Counter Ion Effects on Metal Fitness Measurements

## Research Question
When bacteria are exposed to metal salts (CoCl₂, NiCl₂, CuCl₂), how much of the observed fitness effect is caused by the metal cation versus the counter anion (chloride)? Does correcting for chloride confounding change the conclusions of the Pan-Bacterial Metal Fitness Atlas?

## Status
Completed — counter ions are NOT the primary confound. 39.8% of metal-important genes overlap with NaCl stress, but this reflects shared cellular vulnerability (not chloride from metal salts). Zinc sulfate (0 mM Cl⁻) shows higher overlap than most chloride metals. The Metal Fitness Atlas core enrichment is robust after correction. See [Report](REPORT.md) for full findings.

## Overview
The Fitness Browser's 559 metal experiments predominantly use chloride salts. At high concentrations (e.g., 250 mM CoCl₂ delivers 500 mM Cl⁻), the counter ion itself may cause significant fitness effects. This project leverages NaCl stress experiments available for 25 metal-tested organisms to decompose the metal fitness signal into a shared-stress component and a metal-specific component, then re-evaluates the Metal Fitness Atlas conclusions after correction. The key finding: the ~40% overlap is driven by shared stress biology (envelope damage, ion homeostasis), not counter ion contamination.
