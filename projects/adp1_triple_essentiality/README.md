# ADP1 Triple Essentiality Concordance

## Research Question
Among genes that TnSeq says are dispensable in *Acinetobacter baylyi* ADP1, does FBA correctly predict which ones have growth defects? Can direct mutant growth rate measurements serve as an independent axis to evaluate where computational (FBA) and genetic (TnSeq) methods agree or disagree?

## Status
Complete — FBA essentiality class does not predict growth defects among TnSeq-dispensable genes (chi-squared p=0.63). See [Report](REPORT.md) for findings.

## Overview
The `acinetobacter_adp1_explorer` project found 74% concordance between FBA and TnSeq essentiality for ADP1, but never incorporated the mutant growth rate data as a third axis. This project adds mutant growth rates on 8 carbon sources as an independent experimental measure.

**Key constraint**: All 478 triple-covered genes (having TnSeq + FBA + growth data) are TnSeq-dispensable on minimal media. This is biologically expected — TnSeq-essential genes have no viable deletion mutants, so they cannot have growth rate measurements. The analysis therefore asks: among dispensable genes, does FBA correctly predict which ones matter for growth?

The `gene_phenotypes` table provides per-carbon-source FBA flux predictions, enabling condition-matched comparisons for 6 of 8 carbon sources (glucose, acetate, asparagine, butanediol, glucarate, lactate).

## Data Sources
- **User-provided**: `user_data/berdl_tables.db` — SQLite database with ADP1 genome features, metabolic model, phenotypes, and pangenome data (from `acinetobacter_adp1_explorer`)
  - `genome_features` table: 5,852 genes, 51 columns (TnSeq, FBA class, mutant growth x 8 conditions, COG, KO, pangenome)
  - `gene_phenotypes` table: 239K rows — per-gene per-carbon-source FBA flux predictions
- **Cluster mapping**: `data/cluster_id_mapping.csv` — 4,891 BERDL-to-ADP1 pangenome cluster ID mappings (from `acinetobacter_adp1_explorer`)
